# Robot_Project

Simple Vanilla Python project for robotics class in Automation Engineering Department of Internation Hellenic University.
Python Graphics , Tkinter MessageBox for Inputs , Basic Animations.

The program takes inputs for lengths of two robotic arms and their starting point in cartesian 2D environment.
Afterwards, it can calculate the shortest route of the movement from the initial point to the next.

I do not own the idea copyrights.
